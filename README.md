**`Data Science and Analytics`**

Driven by curiosity, I got into the field of data science and have been captivated ever since. I'm excited about helping people streamline their data preprocessing tasks, enabling them to focus on the important parts of their business.

With proficient technical skills, I aim to increase the value of data, converting raw information into powerful insights that facilitate informed decision-making.

👨🏻‍💻 Having worked across supply chain, retail, and finance, I've been involved in roles where analyzing and interpreting data has become one of the most exciting parts of my career. Ultimately, my findings and how I presented them to stakeholders provided them with the information needed to take action.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Jesus' Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   My journey began 4 years ago when I was doing my analysis in Excel, I noticed that I wanted to do more functions quickly, and not wait 15 minutes to have the output. When looking for solutions on Youtube I found how Python can help you to analyze a considerable amount of data without depending on Excel. 


Starting from manipulating my data, cleaning, and visualising was a common task. Then discovering the libraries for statistical analysis such as **Numpy**, **Keras**, **Scipy**, **Scikit-Learn** was mind-blowing and how quickly I could get to those results whereas Excel took me a while. Now I am passionate about helping people by showing them and demonstrating how their lives can improved once they know more tools to make their lives easy.
